I have recently completed my Ph.D. and joined MBZUAI (a top-20 AI research institue). 

Previously, I worked with Sony AI. I am an assistant researcher at AI Theory Group of [Huawei's Noah Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/) in Hong Kong and a third-year Ph.D. student at [MLVC](https://sites.google.com/khu.ac.kr/mlvclab/) Lab in South Korea.

 I served as a research associate at the Signal Processing and Information Decoding Research - [SPIDER]((http://www.spider.itu.edu.pk)), Lab located in [Information Technology University](http://www.itu.edu.pk/). During my MS, I was a teaching assistant for two graduate courses taught by [Dr. Ali Ahmed](https://itu.edu.pk/faculty-itu/dr-ali-ahmed/) (advance signal processing and [machine learning](https://awaisrauf.github.io/ee512/)) and three undergraduate courses taught by [Usama Bin Sikandar](http://usamabinsikandar.weebly.com/teaching.html).
