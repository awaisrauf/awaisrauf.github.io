I have recently completed my Ph.D. and have joined MBZUAI ([among top-20 in AI research](https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&mlmining&nlp&world)) as a research associate.

Previously, I was a student research assistant at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/) (Japan) and as an assistant researcher at AI Theory Group of [Huawei's Noah Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/) in Hong Kong. I completed my Ph.D. from [MLVC Lab](https://sites.google.com/khu.ac.kr/mlvclab/) in South Korea, where I was a recipient of the presidential scholarship.

 I also served as a research associate at [SPIDER Research Lab]((http://www.spider.itu.edu.pk)) at [ITU](http://www.itu.edu.pk/) and a teaching assistant for two graduate courses (including [machine learning](https://awaisrauf.github.io/ee512/)) and three undergraduate courses.
