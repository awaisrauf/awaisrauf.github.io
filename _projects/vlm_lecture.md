These are slides for a guest lecture on foundational vision-language models delivered at [MBZ University of Artificial Intelligence](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) in **September 2023**. 
I covered core concepts in the evolution of vision-language models by explaining eight different large vision-language models.
