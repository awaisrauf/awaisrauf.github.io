My research focuses on robust and safe AI systems, multi-modal learning, and the application of AI in non-CS domains.
My research has been published in leading AI and computer vision venues, including NeurIPS ([#1 in AI](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_artificialintelligence)), ICCV ([#2 in CV](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computervisionpatternrecognition)), ECCV ([#3 in CV](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computervisionpatternrecognition)), TPAMI ([IF=20.8](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=34)), TNNLS ([IF=10.4](https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-neural-networks-and-learning-systems)), MICCAI ([#4 in Med. Imaging](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=med_radiologymedicalimaging)), COLING ([#5 in Comp. Linguistics](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computationallinguistics)), ICASSP ([#3 in Signal Processing](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_signalprocessing)), and WACV ([#9 in CV](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_computervisionpatternrecognition)).

Moreover, I regularly contribute as a reviewer in top AI venues, including NeurIPS, CVPR, ICLR, ICCV, ECCV, AISTATS, WACV, BMVC, and CoLLAs. I have served on the program committee for various workshops, such as New in ML at NeurIP 2023; Socially Responsible Machine Learning at ICLR 2022; The Art of Robustness: Devil and Angel in Adversarial Machine at CVPR 2022; Socially Responsible Machine Learning at ICML 2021; The 2nd Workshop on Adversarial Robustness In the Real World at ICCV 2021; Workshop on Security and Safety in Machine Learning Systems at ICLR 2021; Adversarial Robustness in the Real World (AROW) at ECCV 2020.
